## Glucose Level Predicter
### Introduction & Scope
This Python script uses the Dexcom Overview Report csv file as its dataset, in order to train an ML model in order to predict future glucose values. The current and future glucose values are represented in a graph. The graph can help the patient know where they will roughly stand with regards to their glucose values in the near future which can help adjust their insulin dosage, meals, among other aspects that affect blood sugar levels. In the end, this can all help the user lower their h1ac.
