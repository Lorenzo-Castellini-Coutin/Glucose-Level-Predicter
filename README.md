## Glucose Level Predicter
### Introduction & Scope
This Python script uses the Dexcom Overview Report csv file as its dataset, in order to train an ML model in order to predict future glucose values. The current and future glucose values are represented in a graph. The graph can help the patient know where they will roughly stand with regards to their glucose values in the near future which can help adjust their insulin dosage, meals, among other aspects that affect blood sugar levels. In the end, this can all help the user lower their h1ac.
### How it works?
The script's model is currently under remodeling....
### Advisory on Usage
This script gives its user's a general idea about their glucose levels, but it has its limitations. This predicter does not replace a professional's adivce, therefore, for more detailed and accurate information please visit your doctor. Furthermore, this script is not associated with the Dexcom company.
### Additional Notes
The Dexcom Overview Report csv files contains confidential information with regards to a patient's glucose levels, therefore, beware before using the script for your own glucose levels, since the model uses said levels to form a prediction.
